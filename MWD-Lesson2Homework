<p> <i>Wearable technology, wearables, fashionable technology, wearable devices, tech togs, or fashion electronics</i>
are smart electronic devices 
(electronic device with micro-controllers) that can be incorporated into clothing or worn on the body as implants or accessories.<b>[1][2][3][4]</b>

Wearable devices such as activity trackers are best example of <i>the Internet of Things</i>, since <b>"things"</b> such as electronics, software, sensors, 
and connectivity are effectors that enable objects to exchange data (including data quality<b>[5]</b>) through the internet with a manufacturer, operator, 
and/or other connected devices, without requiring human intervention.

Wearable technology has a variety of applications which grows as the field itself expands. It appears prominently in consumer electronics with the 
popularization of the smartwatch and activity tracker. Apart from commercial uses, wearable technology is being incorporated into navigation systems, 
advanced textiles, and healthcare. </p>
